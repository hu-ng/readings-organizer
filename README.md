# Class Readings Organizer

With a ton of readings to do for my classes, I created this tool to organize them in my local system! The script does two things:
1. It watches the *Downloads* folder for files named in a specified manner (ex: *B112_1_2_Marketing Basics.pdf*).
2. Then it moves them to the correct subdirectories (or create them if none existed) in my local *Readings* folder (ex: *B112/1_2/B112_1_2_Marketing Basics.pdf*).

In the future, it would be nice to make a generalized version of this script, such that I can make a custom alert for any file type and associate it with any directory.
